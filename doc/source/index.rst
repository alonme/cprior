Welcome to CPrior's documentation!
==================================

CPrior has functionalities to perform Bayesian statistics and running A/B and multivariate testing. 

CPrior includes several conjugate prior distributions and has been developed focusing on performance, implementing many closed-forms in terms of special functions to obtain fast and accurate results, avoiding Monte Carlo methods whenever possible.
